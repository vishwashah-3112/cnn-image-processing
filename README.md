# cnn-image-processing
This repository is dedicated to an object recognition project that leverages advanced image processing techniques. Our goal is to develop a robust system for identifying and localizing objects within images, with a particular focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and computer vision algorithms.
# Image Processing (Object Recognition) Project

This project is focused on object recognition using image processing techniques. It includes code and resources related to image classification, specifically for identifying objects in images. The code uses a MobileNetV2-based model for feature extraction and classification.

## Define Dataset Paths

Define the paths to your dataset. These paths are crucial for organizing your data during the image processing workflow.

## Dataset Preparation Begins

In this section, directories for training, validation, and test sets are created. The code checks if the directories exist and creates them if they don't.

## Define Class Names

This section defines the class names or object names that the model will recognize. Modify this list to match your project's classes.

## Dataset Preprocessing Step

This part of the code organizes the dataset into subdirectories based on class labels. This structured organization makes it easier to load and preprocess data during model training.

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is applied to the dataset to increase its size and diversity. This helps improve the model's ability to generalize.

## Data Generators

Load and prepare data generators for training and validation datasets.

## MobileNetV2 Base Model

Create a MobileNetV2 base model with pre-trained weights. Customize it with additional layers for classification.

## Freezing the Layers

Freeze the layers in the base model to preserve pre-trained knowledge while training custom layers.

## Compile the Model

Compile the model with an optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metrics.

## Train the Model

This section trains the model using the prepared dataset and data generators.

## Test Accuracy

Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test dataset.

## Model Saving

Save the trained model to a file.

## Making Predictions

Use the saved model to make predictions on a random image.
